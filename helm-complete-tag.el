;;; Commentary:
;; 
;;  1. using etags file to create a list of candidates
;;  2. using helm interface to display/paste candidates that returns at 1st step
;;
;;; Code:


(message "%s" 
         (helm :sources (helm-build-sync-source "test"
                          :candidates '(one two three)
                          :fuzzy-match t)
               :buffer "*helm test*")
         )
